![Personality Description](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/02/f4/ea/02f4ea86d414ab4addc9f38647cc7392.jpg)

## About Me
I enjoy rollerblading around my neighborhood and having art nights with friends. Watercolors and acrylics are my current favorite mediums to use, although I studied ceramics in undergrad.

## Past Coding Experience
Back in the day, I could create a pretty great MySpace page with music that force-played. So far this course has involved a lot of new learning.

## Career Goals
1. Learn from the experience of having my subsidiary sold to another company this year.
2. Develop myself further as a leader and continue to create an inclusive and diverse workplace.
3. Focus on creating and marketing myself as an artist.
